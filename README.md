# Prime's Problem

I was watching a video by Prime and he mentioned an interesting interview
problem related to managing asynchronous request queues

## Problem Statement
**"I've a queue which returns a promise, and you have to hand it a promise
factory. When they call the promise factory, your jobs get to execute. The
async request queue can have only up to 3 running tasks at any one time."**
